    This is your custom class that is instantiated as the main app object instance,
    it inherits from the supplied IoTApp class found in the libs/iot_app.py module
    which is copied when the Huzzah32 is prepared.
    This IoTApp in turn encapsulates an instance of the ProtoRig class (which is 
    found in libs/proto_rig.py) and exposes a number of properties of this ProtoRig
    instance so you do not have to do this yourself.
    Also, the IoTApp provides an execution loop that can be started by calling the
    run() method of the IoTApp class (which is of course inherited into your custom
    app class). All you have to do is define your program by providing implementations
    of the init(), loop() and deinit() methods.
    Looping of your program can be controlled using the finished flag property of
    your custom class.
